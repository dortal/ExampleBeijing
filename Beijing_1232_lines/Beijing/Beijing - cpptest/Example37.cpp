/* forgot to set umask */
/* umask() controls the permissions of created by the open call, but the
   permission mask is passed to the child process in an exec(). If this
   is a setuid program, the attacker can set a permission mask that makes
   these files world-writable, but the new file may be a system-critical
   one. In this program, the programmer uses the umask that existed when
   the program was exec()ed, but that umask might be controlled by an
   attacker.
