/* stat called on filename */
/* This is a simple race condition, allowing the attacker to change the file
   named in argv[1] to a symbolic link after it's tested but before the file 
   is opened. 

   Many scanners detect the call to stat() on line 23, and while stat() is
   almost certainly a sign of trouble in this particular context, it
   needn't always be. A better scanner would actually detect the race
   condition between the open on line line 14 and the stat on line 23.
